Work in an existing application or make a new one

I will be making a new application with Posts (very original)
This exercise will ajaxify the delete post action.

(if you're starting fresh, make sure to include jquery in your application!)

....


In your posts index view, or wherever you put the link to delete a post(or whatever):
Edit your delete link to include remote: true

<%= link_to 'Destroy', post, method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?' }, :remote => true, :class => 'delete_post' %>

Now create a destroy.js.erb view file in the same folder with this code:

$('.delete_post').bind('ajax:success', function() {
   $(this).closest('tr').fadeOut();
});

This will target the link with the class "delete_post" and bind the action to an ajax call that fades out the closest table row.

We need to edit the destroy action in our controller to handle this js response.

In the destroy action, add at the bottom:

> format.js { render :layout => false }

Test it out, create a few posts, and click the delete button.
