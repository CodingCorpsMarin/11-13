Competencies
AJAX works a little bit differently in Rails than Sinatra
The idea is the same: an event is triggered, the client calls the server, the server processes the request, the client receives a response
Rails already has basic AJAX built in, you just need to call it
Typically, AJAX will trigger on a click event, most likely, a link, so in rails, a 'link_to' element
In order for Javascript to be allowed, "remote: true"/":remote => true" etc will need to be declared
This tells the application to run the request through rails-ujs (unobstructed javascript) rather than the normal channels
From there, the application needs a JS view to handle the commands. They are typically named "[action].js.erb", 
this filetype can handle both js and ruby in addition to html, make one for each js action
The jquery/ajax code is then written in the respective js.erb files
Finally, the actions in the controller must be edited to have a response for the js request.

Applications
