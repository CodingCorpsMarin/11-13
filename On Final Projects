We will be starting final projects next week. Some students will not working on final projects, but for those of you who will, you will be working in
groups of ~4 to create something to demonstrate your learning.

Please be mindful of your attendance as others will be relying on you to be present.

As mentioned before, final projects should be a showcase of what you've learned, or a demonstration of what you're capable of. 
Students will present project pitches, so think of something you would like to work on.

Some examples of projects to get your juices flowing:
Tinder, but for food. (Swipe/Approve of pictures of food from local restaurants to help decide what to eat)
Movie Review app (self-explanatory?)
Co-working app (allow users to pair up for projects within a local radius, complete with messaging)
Scavenger Hunt (allow users to create their own city-wide scavenger hunts)
..etc, etc, etc.

Start brainstorming and be prepared with an idea or two by next week.
